# Wiggle — Onboarding & Configuration Reference

Everything a new contributor or operator needs: what Wiggle is, how to get it running, how to
author workflows, and **every configuration option** in one place.

## 1. What Wiggle is

A **durable, cellular state-machine platform**. You describe a process as a graph with a
`java.util.stream`-style DSL; a **server** runs it as a durable state machine (tokens over the graph)
that survives crashes and resumes where it left off; **workers** pull work when they have capacity and
run the step logic. Its distinctive move is **cellular**: a namespace becomes a *cell* — its own
database and its own cluster — and an optional **coordinator** shards work across cells with
directory-free routing and zero-migration rebalancing. See `README.md` for the elevator pitch and
`docs/local-execution.md` for the execution-mode deep dive.

Core properties: durable (survives restarts), exactly-once dispatch and at-least-once execution,
pull-based workers (no inbound connectivity), content-addressed immutable definitions, multi-node
clustering over a shared database, and **cellular sharding** — a namespace is a cell with its own
database and cluster, placed by consistent hashing over epochs and rebalanced by drain/retire (a single
cluster runs unchanged without a coordinator). Under a coordinator each node sets an explicit cell id
(`WIGGLE_CELL_ID`), and a namespace becomes resolvable only after an epoch names its cells
(`wiggle open-epoch`) — until then it is not-ready by design (no implicit cell). See
`docs/sharding-and-epochs.md`.

---

## 2. Getting the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hadielmougy/wiggle.git
cd wiggle
./gradlew build          # compiles everything and runs the test suite
```

Prerequisites:

- **JDK 21+** (the Gradle toolchain pins language level 21).
- The **Gradle wrapper** is committed (`./gradlew`); no local Gradle needed. If it's ever missing,
  regenerate once with `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.10`.
- **Docker** only for the Postgres cluster demos ([§4.3](#43-a-cluster-on-postgres)); nothing else needs it.

Dev loop:

```bash
./gradlew build                        # full build + tests
./gradlew check                        # tests only (JUnit)
./gradlew :tests:run                   # the conformance scenarios, framework-free, no network
./gradlew :module:test --tests "Foo"   # a single test class
```

Branch off `main`, keep changes focused, and run `./gradlew check` before pushing. Schema changes
go through the migration runner ([§7.4](#74-schema-migrations)), never by editing an already-released migration.

## 3. Modules

| Module | What's in it | Published artifact |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | JSON, the compiled graph model, retry policy, execution mode, wire records | `wiggle-core` |
| `proto` | the `WiggleControlPlane` gRPC service + generated stubs | `wiggle-proto` |
| `client` | the workflow DSL, `WiggleClient`, the pulling `Worker` | `wiggle-client` |
| `server` | engine, cluster manager, housekeeper, queue-lag monitor, gRPC API, `/healthz` probe, in-memory store, injected `StorageFactory` | `wiggle-server` |
| `jdbc` | shared dialect-aware, HikariCP-pooled JDBC store | `wiggle-jdbc` |
| `postgres` | PostgreSQL + H2 dialects | `wiggle-postgres` |
| `mysql` | MySQL / MariaDB dialect | `wiggle-mysql` |
| `oracle` | Oracle Database dialect | `wiggle-oracle` |
| `sqlserver` | Microsoft SQL Server dialect | `wiggle-sqlserver` |
| `dist` | runnable standalone server bundling every backend (what the Docker image runs) | *(not published)* |
| `example` | order-fulfilment demo, standalone worker/submitter, benchmark | *(not published)* |
| `tests` | conformance scenarios + JUnit wrapper | *(not published)* |

Published under group `io.github.hadielmougy`, version **2.1.8** (the runnable `dist` module is not
published). The server core is database-agnostic; it builds its store from an injected
`StorageFactory` and the backend is selected from the URL scheme ([§7.2](#72-storage-backends)).

---

## 4. Running it

### 4.1 Single node (in-memory) — dev default

```bash
./gradlew :dist:run                          # gRPC on :8080, in-memory store
./gradlew :example:run                          # embedded server + worker + a few orders, one JVM
```

### 4.2 Server + workers as separate processes

```bash
./gradlew :dist:run                                  # terminal 1
./gradlew :example:runWorker                            # terminal 2 (WIGGLE_URL=localhost:8080)
./gradlew :example:submitOrders -Pcount=20             # terminal 3
```

### 4.3 A cluster on Postgres

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres        # Postgres on :5433 (see docker-compose.yml)
scripts/cluster.sh 20                 # three server nodes, two workers, one Postgres

# or on Kubernetes (kind):
scripts/kind-up.sh 3                   # 3 server pods + Postgres at localhost:30080
scripts/run-workers.sh 5 20            # 5 local workers, then submit 20 orders
scripts/kind-down.sh                   # tear down
```

### 4.4 As a container (Docker)

The `Dockerfile` builds one image for **every role** (`WIGGLE_ROLE=cell ∣ coordinator ∣ console`,
every storage backend bundled, picked from the URL scheme); it reads the same env vars as the JAR
([§6](#6-configuration-reference)). TLS is set the same way — `WIGGLE_TLS_KEYSTORE` + a mounted
keystore.

```bash
# run the released image: an in-memory server (gRPC :8080, /healthz probe optional)
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hadielmougy/wiggle:2.1.8

# the ops console against it (same image, different role) → http://localhost:8090
docker run --rm -p 8090:8090 -e WIGGLE_ROLE=console -e WIGGLE_URL=host.docker.internal:8080 \
  -e WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=change-me hadielmougy/wiggle:2.1.8

# a complete stack: server + Postgres + console with login, durable volume, no TLS
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d      # → http://localhost:8090 (admin / change-me)

# build locally / publish multi-arch
docker build -t wiggle .
scripts/docker-release.sh                             # buildx amd64+arm64, pushes to a registry
```

The image is the control plane (+ optional console role) only; run **workers** as separate
processes against `:8080` (your app on `wiggle-client`, or `./gradlew :example:runWorker`).

### 4.5 Handy scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/build.sh` | `javac` over the whole monorepo, no Gradle |
| `scripts/verify.sh` | run the conformance suite |
| `scripts/demo.sh` | run the single-JVM demo |
| `scripts/cluster.sh [count]` | 3 nodes + 2 workers on local Postgres |
| `scripts/kind-up.sh [nodes]` / `kind-down.sh` | Postgres cluster on kind |
| `scripts/run-workers.sh <workers> [submit]` | run N worker JVMs against `WIGGLE_URL` |
| `scripts/bump-version.sh <new-version>` | rewrite the version everywhere (jars + Docker tag + docs) from the current one |
| `scripts/docker-release.sh` | build & push the multi-arch server image |

### 4.6 Gradle tasks

| Task | Runs |
|---|---|
| `:dist:run` | standalone server (`com.wiggle.dist.Main`, every backend bundled) |
| `:dist:installDist` | server distribution (bundles every storage backend) — used by the Docker image |
| `:example:run` | `Demo` (embedded end-to-end) |
| `:example:runWorker` | `WorkerMain` |
| `:example:submitOrders -Pcount=N` | `SubmitOrders` |
| `:example:bench` | `Benchmark` (throughput micro-benchmark, [§7.6](#76-benchmarking)) |
| `:tests:run` | `Scenarios` (framework-free conformance) |

---

## 5. Authoring workflows

A definition is pure **topology** — named nodes and their wiring, no logic and no context type.
`build()` returns a `Blueprint` (just the graph):

```java
Blueprint orders = Workflow.define("order-fulfilment")
        .step("validate")
        .gate("in-stock")
        .fork(
                Branch.of("payment",  s -> s.step("authorise", RetryPolicy.exponential(5, ofMillis(100)))
                                            .step("capture")),
                Branch.of("shipping", s -> s.step("reserve")
                                            .sleep("await", ofMillis(300))
                                            .step("label")))
        .combine("merge")   // fork always rejoins at a mandatory combine
        .step("notify")
        .build();
```

The step logic is a separate class annotated `@Handlers("<workflow-name>")`, bound on a worker by
name. Each method whose name matches a step (case/style-insensitive, so `inStock` serves `in-stock`)
is a handler; its signature defines the step — one parameter is the input (decoded from JSON), a
`boolean` return is a gate, `void` is an effect, any other return is a task whose value becomes the
next context (types may change from step to step, like `Stream.map`):

```java
@Handlers("order-fulfilment")
class OrderHandlers {
    public Order   validate(Order o)  { return o.withStatus("VALIDATED"); }
    public boolean inStock(Order o)   { return o.quantity() > 0; }        // gate
    public Order   authorise(Order o) { return o.withPaymentRef(auth(o)); }
    public Order   capture(Order o)   { return o.log("captured"); }
    public Order   reserve(Order o)   { return o.withShipmentRef(reserve(o)); }
    public Order   label(Order o)     { return o.withTrackingLabel(print(o)); }
    public Order   notify(Order o)    { return o.withStatus("FULFILLED"); }
}
```

Bind it on the worker with `new Worker(client, "w").register(orders).handlers(new OrderHandlers())`.
A `combine` node (`merge`) must have an explicit handler — a method taking `@Arm("branch")`
parameters (each branch's result) plus an optional `@Context` parameter (the pre-fork context),
whose return is the COMPLETE post-join context. There is no implicit fold: a combine served by no
worker fails its task, and keys the handler does not return do not survive the join.

### 5.1 Operations

Every operation is topology only — it names a node; the matching `@Handlers` method supplies its logic.

| Operation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `step(name)` / `step(name, retry)` / `then(...)` | run the step's handler on a worker; its result becomes the new context |
| `effect(name)` | the handler runs for a side effect (a `void` method); context unchanged |
| `gate(name)` | continue only while the guard handler returns true; false ends the instance as `gated:<name>` |
| `choose(when(...), …, otherwise(...))` | switch/case: first matching guard's branch runs |
| `fork(branches…).combine(name)` | run branches in parallel on isolated context copies, then rejoin at the mandatory `combine` |
| `forEach(itemsKey, body).combine(name)` | runtime fan-out: one **isolated** branch per element of the list (or map) at `itemsKey`. **The element IS the item's context** — body handlers take the item's value (scalars included) and their return replaces it; the frozen base is available **either way — your choice**: declare a `@Context` parameter, or call `Step.base()` (the position/source key at `Step.itemIndex()`/`Step.itemMapKey()`). Combines get the same choice: `@Context` parameter or `Step.base()`. The **mandatory** combine receives `@Context` plus the collected final values (`List`/`Set` for a list input, `Map` keyed like a map input) and returns the complete post-join context. `forEach(name, itemsKey, body)` names the node explicitly |
| `doWhile(name, body)` | run `body`, then repeat while the guard handler named `name` holds (at least once) |
| `sleep(name, duration)` | server-side timer; holds no worker |
| `awaitSignal(name[, timeout[, escalation]])` | wait for a named external signal; optional deadline escalates or fails |
| `subWorkflow(name, workflow)` | run another workflow as a child; result merges back, failure propagates |
| `step(name, queue)` / `defaultQueue(q)` | route a step (or every following step) to a dedicated worker pool |
| `execution(mode)` | set the execution mode ([§6.4](#64-execution-modes)) |
| `checkpoint()` | (LOCAL_ASYNC) flush this step to the server before the next runs |
| `build()` | produce the `Blueprint` |

`step`/`effect`/`gate` take an optional trailing `RetryPolicy`. The context type is not fixed by the
definition — each handler picks the type it works in by its signature (a typed record, or a
`Map<String, Object>` for raw JSON), and a method may return a different type than it takes.

**Evolving a record's schema.** A handler decodes the persisted JSON into its parameter type
reflectively, so adding, renaming, or retyping a field silently defaults/loses data — or fails to
decode — for instances already in flight (the workflow *version* hashes only the graph topology, not
the context type). Opt into custom decoding with a `@Decode` method in the handler class: it takes the
raw JSON (`Map<String, Object>`) and returns the current type, running instead of the default mapping
wherever a step or combine parameter of that type is bound. It's the seam for schema-version upcasts
or a bespoke codec:

```java
@Handlers("order-fulfilment")
class OrderHandlers {
    @Decode
    public Order load(Map<String, Object> raw) {     // upcast an older shape to the current Order
        raw.putIfAbsent("currency", "USD");           // e.g. default a field added in a later version
        return RecordMapper.fromJson(raw, Order.class);
    }
    // ... step methods, which now receive the upcast Order ...
}
```

### 5.2 Running instances

```java
try (WiggleClient client = new WiggleClient("localhost:8080")) {
    String id = client.start(orders, Order.of(...));
    InstanceView v = client.awaitCompletion(id, Duration.ofSeconds(30));   // COMPLETED | FAILED | CANCELLED
    client.cancel(id, "reason");
}
```

## 6. Configuration reference

### 6.1 How settings are supplied

The **server** reads each setting from a **system property first, then an environment variable**,
falling back to a default (`ServerConfig.fromEnvironment()`). So `-Dwiggle.port=9090` and
`WIGGLE_PORT=9090` are equivalent. For the application distribution, pass JVM flags via the
`WIGGLE_OPTS` (or `JAVA_OPTS`) environment variable that `bin/wiggle` honours.

The **worker** is configured programmatically via `WorkerOptions` ([§6.5](#65-worker--workeroptions-programmatic)); the `WIGGLE_*` worker
variables in [§6.7](#67-example-worker--benchmark-variables) are conventions of the *example* `WorkerMain`, not the client library.

### 6.2 Server — core & storage

| Env var | System property | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WIGGLE_PORT` | `wiggle.port` | `8080` | gRPC port (`0` = pick a free one) |
| `WIGGLE_NODE_NAME` | `wiggle.node.name` | hostname | name shown in cluster membership |
| `WIGGLE_JDBC_URL` | `wiggle.jdbc.url` | *(unset)* | **unset = in-memory, single node**; set to cluster on a database |
| `WIGGLE_JDBC_USER` | `wiggle.jdbc.user` | *(unset)* | database user |
| `WIGGLE_JDBC_PASSWORD` | `wiggle.jdbc.password` | *(unset)* | database password |
| `WIGGLE_JDBC_POOL_SIZE` | `wiggle.jdbc.poolSize` | `10` | JDBC connection pool size |

### 6.3 Server — engine, cluster & housekeeping

| Env var | System property | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WIGGLE_LEASE_MILLIS` | `wiggle.lease.millis` | `30000` | default task lease before a stalled step is reclaimed |
| `WIGGLE_LONGPOLL_MAX_MILLIS` | `wiggle.longpoll.maxMillis` | `20000` | server-side cap on how long a `PollTasks` may block |
| `WIGGLE_POLL_INTERVAL_MILLIS` | `wiggle.poll.intervalMillis` | `1000` | housekeeping tick cadence (timers, lease reclaim, deadlines) |
| `WIGGLE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MILLIS` | `wiggle.heartbeat.intervalMillis` | `5000` | cluster heartbeat/election interval |
| `WIGGLE_MISSED_HEARTBEATS` | `wiggle.heartbeat.missedBeforeDead` | `3` | missed beats before a node is considered dead |
| `WIGGLE_RETENTION_MILLIS` | `wiggle.retention.millis` | `86400000` | how long finished instances are kept before purge |
| `WIGGLE_HOUSEKEEPING_BATCH` | `wiggle.housekeeping.batch` | `100` | max items a housekeeping sweep processes per tick |
| `WIGGLE_ADAPTIVE_HOUSEKEEPING` | `wiggle.adaptive.housekeeping` | `false` | a sweep that fills its batch runs again immediately (drain mode) — removes the batch÷tick promotion ceiling under backlog (measured: 100 → ~1,700 timers/sec at defaults); idle cost unchanged |
| `WIGGLE_ADAPTIVE_FALLBACK_POLL` | `wiggle.adaptive.fallback` | `false` | freshly-parked long-polls re-claim quickly (fallback÷4) and decay to the configured interval — cuts cross-node dispatch latency in a multi-node cluster (measured: p50 105 → 30 ms); idle DB cost bounded |
| `WIGGLE_QUEUE_LAG_CHECK_INTERVAL_MILLIS` | `wiggle.queueLag.checkIntervalMillis` | `5000` | how often the leader checks the backlog ([§7.5](#75-queue-lag-monitoring)) |
| `WIGGLE_QUEUE_LAG_WARN_MILLIS` | `wiggle.queueLag.warnThresholdMillis` | `10000` | WARN once the backlog isn't draining within this budget |

### 6.4 Execution modes

Set per workflow in the DSL: `Workflow.define(...).execution(ExecutionMode.LOCAL_SYNC)`. The mode
is part of the definition's **content hash**, so an in-flight instance keeps the mode it started on.

| Mode | Behaviour | Crash blast radius | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SERVER` (default) | server advances one node per claim | one step | anything non-idempotent |
| `LOCAL_SYNC` | worker chains steps, commits each before the next | one step (same as SERVER) | most workflows — safe speedup |
| `LOCAL_ASYNC` | worker buffers up to `localBatchSize` steps, flushes in one call at handback | whole batch re-runs | idempotent, throughput-critical |
| `DEFAULT` | defer to the server default (currently resolves to `SERVER`) | — | leave the choice to deployment |

`.checkpoint()` after a step forces LOCAL_ASYNC to commit it before continuing. Details and
benchmark numbers: `docs/local-execution.md`.

### 6.5 Worker — `WorkerOptions` (programmatic)

```java
new Worker(client, "worker-1", WorkerOptions.defaults()
        .withConcurrency(16)
        .withLease(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
        .withLongPollWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .withLocalBatchSize(64));
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `concurrency` | CPU count | max steps in flight at once |
| `lease` | 30s | lease requested per task (renewed by heartbeats) |
| `longPollWait` | 10s | how long the worker lets a poll block server-side |
| `idleBackoff` | 200ms | pause when a poll returns nothing |
| `errorBackoff` | 2s | pause after a poll error |
| `registerOnStart` | true | (re)register blueprints when the worker starts |
| `localBatchSize` | 64 | LOCAL_ASYNC steps buffered before a flush (ignored by SERVER/LOCAL_SYNC) |

### 6.6 Logging

Wiggle logs through the JDK's `System.Logger` (routes to `java.util.logging`), so there's no
logging dependency. See `docs/` / `deploy/logging.properties` and:

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WIGGLE_LOG_FILE` | *(unset)* | set a path to also log to a rotating file (5 × 10 MB) |
| `WIGGLE_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | file level in `System.Logger` names: `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` |
| *(JVM flag)* `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=…` | — | full control via a `logging.properties`; overrides the env shortcut |

Level mapping to java.util.logging: `DEBUG→FINE`, `TRACE→FINER`, `INFO→INFO`, `WARNING→WARNING`,
`ERROR→SEVERE`. INFO is a clean lifecycle narrative (start/stop, membership, leader, registrations,
failures, purges, lag warnings); DEBUG adds per-token/step/RPC detail.

### 6.7 Example worker & benchmark variables

Conventions of the `example` module's `WorkerMain` / `Benchmark` (not the library):

| Env var | Default | Read by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WIGGLE_URL` | `localhost:8080` | WorkerMain, SubmitOrders | server gRPC target (a leading `http(s)://` is stripped) |
| `WIGGLE_WORKER_ID` | `worker-<pid>` | WorkerMain | worker identity |
| `WIGGLE_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | WorkerMain | worker concurrency |
| `WIGGLE_LOCAL_BATCH_SIZE` | `64` | WorkerMain, Benchmark | LOCAL_ASYNC batch size |
| `WIGGLE_EXECUTION_MODE` | `SERVER` | Benchmark | execution mode for the benchmark workflow |
| `WIGGLE_BENCH_STEPS` | `20` | Benchmark | steps in the linear pipeline |
| `WIGGLE_BENCH_COUNT` | `2000` | Benchmark | instances to run |
| `WIGGLE_BENCH_WORKERS` | `4` | Benchmark | worker JVM-internal instances |
| `WIGGLE_JDBC_URL` / `_USER` / `_PASSWORD` | *(unset)* | Benchmark | run the benchmark against a real DB |

> The example workflows set their mode in code via `.execution(...)`. To sweep modes without
> editing, change `OrderFulfilment.blueprint()` to call the provided `mode()` helper (reads
> `WIGGLE_EXECUTION_MODE`); the benchmark already reads it.

## 7. Operations

### 7.1 The ops console (web UI)

The web UI is the standalone **ops console** — the `console` module, a separate process that is a
**pure gRPC client** (embedded Tomcat + servlets). Server/cell nodes serve **no UI**; a node's
`WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_PORT` (default `0` = off) exposes only the **`/healthz`** probe for
liveness/readiness checks.

One binary, two modes, chosen by env:

```bash
# direct mode: one cluster
WIGGLE_URL=localhost:8080 ./gradlew :console:run          # → http://localhost:8090

# coordinator mode: a whole sharded namespace (fan queries across its cells,
# route cancel/signal to the owning cell by instance id)
WIGGLE_COORDINATOR_URL=coordinator:8099 WIGGLE_NAMESPACE=orders ./gradlew :console:run

# or via the Docker image
WIGGLE_ROLE=console WIGGLE_URL=server:8080 …
```

The SPA (ClojureScript + Reagent, source in `dashboard-ui/`, compiled into the **console** jar)
has four tabs: **Instances** (filter, search by **instance id or correlation id**, a live trace
overlaying token status onto the workflow diagram, cancel, inline signal delivery), **Workflows**
(render any compiled graph), **Schedules** (create/delete interval and cron schedules), and
**Signals**. `./gradlew :console:build` compiles the bundle automatically (needs Node;
`-PskipDashboard` or a missing Node toolchain skips it). Dev loop: `cd dashboard-ui &&
npx shadow-cljs watch app` (hot reload on :8280, proxying `/api` to a console on :8090).

**Auth.** Set `WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` to require login as the **operator** account
(`WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_USER`, default `admin`). Optionally also set
`WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_VIEWER_PASSWORD` for a **read-only viewer** account
(`WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_VIEWER_USER`, default `viewer`): a viewer sees everything but any mutating call
(cancel, signal, schedule — every non-GET `/api/*`) is rejected. Browsers get a `/login` form that
sets an HttpOnly session cookie; programmatic clients can use HTTP Basic auth. Unset password =
open access (warning at startup). Credentials travel cleartext over plain HTTP, so serve over TLS
for anything exposed.

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WIGGLE_URL` | `localhost:8080` | direct mode: the one cluster to serve |
| `WIGGLE_COORDINATOR_URL` + `WIGGLE_NAMESPACE` (+ `WIGGLE_REGION`) | *(unset)* | coordinator mode |
| `WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_PORT` | `8090` | console HTTP port |
| `WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_USER` / `WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | `admin` / *(unset)* | operator login; unset = open |
| `WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_VIEWER_USER` / `WIGGLE_DASHBOARD_VIEWER_PASSWORD` | `viewer` / *(unset)* | optional read-only account |
| `WIGGLE_TLS_*` | *(unset)* | HTTPS for the console + the client certs it presents to cells |

### 7.1a Transport security (TLS / mTLS)

Opt-in and shared by the gRPC API and the console's HTTP. A **keystore** turns TLS on for both;
a **truststore** additionally requires client certificates (mTLS on the server) and presents a
client certificate (on a worker/client). Unset ⇒ plaintext for both. Stores are PKCS12 by default;
a `.jks` path is loaded as JKS. Clients/workers read the same variables. TLS secures the channel
and (with mTLS) authenticates the peer, but it is **not authorization** — any trusted peer may call
any RPC; layer the console's login/Basic auth or an external gateway on top for role separation.

| Env var | System property | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WIGGLE_TLS_KEYSTORE` | `wiggle.tls.keystore` | *(unset)* | keystore path; unset = plaintext |
| `WIGGLE_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | `wiggle.tls.keystore.password` | *(unset)* | keystore password |
| `WIGGLE_TLS_TRUSTSTORE` | `wiggle.tls.truststore` | *(unset)* | truststore path; server ⇒ require client certs (mTLS) |
| `WIGGLE_TLS_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD` | `wiggle.tls.truststore.password` | *(unset)* | truststore password |

### 7.2 Storage backends

No URL → in-memory (single node, dev/test). With one, the server builds its store from an injected
`StorageFactory` — **no `ServiceLoader`**: the distribution's `WiggleStorageFactory` maps the URL
scheme to a backend at runtime. The JDBC backends — PostgreSQL / H2 (`wiggle-postgres`),
MySQL / MariaDB (`wiggle-mysql`), Oracle (`wiggle-oracle`), SQL Server (`wiggle-sqlserver`) — share
one HikariCP-pooled, dialect-aware store (`wiggle-jdbc`). The `dist` module (the Docker image)
bundles them all, so a single image serves any of `jdbc:postgresql:`, `jdbc:h2:`,
`jdbc:mysql:` / `jdbc:mariadb:`, `jdbc:oracle:` or `jdbc:sqlserver:`. Another database is a new
module — no engine change.

Embedding the server in your own JVM? Pass the factory explicitly, e.g.
`new WiggleServer(config, cfg -> new JdbcStorage(cfg.jdbcUrl(), cfg.jdbcUser(), cfg.jdbcPassword(),
cfg.jdbcPoolSize(), new PostgresDialect()))` — you depend only on the storage module(s) you use.

### 7.3 Signals, sub-workflows and schedules

`awaitSignal(name)` parks an instance until the named signal arrives; no worker is held. Deliver
via `client.signal(instanceId, name, payload)` (gRPC), the console's Signals tab, or
`POST /api/instances/{id}/signal/{name}` (JSON body merges into the context). Optional deadline:
`awaitSignal(name, timeout)` fails the instance on timeout; the three-arg form runs an escalation
branch instead. Signals are not buffered -- an early delivery is a retryable conflict.

`subWorkflow(name, workflow)` runs a registered workflow as a child with the parent's context;
its final context merges back, its failure/cancellation fails the parent, and cancelling the
parent cascades to children.

Schedules fire a workflow on a fixed interval or a five-field cron expression (UTC),
leader-driven and exactly-once per fire. From the client: `client.createSchedule(workflow,
Duration, context)` / `createCronSchedule(workflow, "0 3 * * *", context)` / `schedules()` /
`deleteSchedule(id)` (gRPC). Over HTTP: `POST /api/schedules {"workflow", "everyMillis"|"cron",
"context"?}`, `GET /api/schedules`, `DELETE /api/schedules/{id}`. Creation is an **upsert keyed
on workflow name** -- a workflow has at most one schedule, so calling create again from any
number of client instances updates it in place rather than creating duplicates.

### 7.4 Schema migrations

`JdbcStorage` runs a **versioned, forward-only** migration list on startup, tracked in
`wf_schema_version`, under a cross-node advisory lock, atomic on Postgres. To evolve the schema,
append a `Migration(n, "name", sql)` — never edit a released one; keep changes backward-compatible
for rolling deploys. Tables: `wf_definition`, `wf_graph_node`, `wf_graph_edge`, `wf_instance`,
`wf_token`, `wf_node`, `wf_schema_version`.

### 7.5 Queue-lag monitoring

The leader watches whether the dispatchable backlog is draining fast enough (backlog vs
cluster-wide completion rate) and logs a `WARNING` when it isn't — a sign of too few workers, a
stuck worker pool, or a slow step. Tune with the two `WIGGLE_QUEUE_LAG_*` knobs ([§6.3](#63-server--engine-cluster--housekeeping)).

### 7.6 Benchmarking

```bash
# in-memory (async ≈ sync, commits are free):
WIGGLE_EXECUTION_MODE=LOCAL_ASYNC ./gradlew :example:bench

# against Postgres (async wins — far fewer WAL fsyncs):
docker compose up -d postgres
WIGGLE_EXECUTION_MODE=LOCAL_ASYNC WIGGLE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/wiggle \
  WIGGLE_JDBC_USER=wiggle WIGGLE_JDBC_PASSWORD=wiggle ./gradlew :example:bench
```
